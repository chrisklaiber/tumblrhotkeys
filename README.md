# Tumblr Hotkeys

Quickly navigate Tumblr posts and pages with the keyboard using this Google Chrome extension.

It is simple and it works. Jump between posts and pages seamlessly.

* j,J moves to the next post or to the next page once the posts run out.
* k,K moves to the previous post or to the previous page when you're already at the first post.
* &larr; always moves to the previous page.
* &rarr; always moves to the next page.

When you forget the hotkeys, mouse over the button in the top left for a refresher.

Or, if the hotkeys are getting in your way, click on the button to shut them off.
